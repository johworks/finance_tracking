I want to create a simple finance management application that I can use to do a few things:

    - Visualize my finanaces
        - Income
        - Expenses ( categories, people )

    - Show the information on a website


Version 0.1:

    There is currently very limited functionality. It is able to take in inputs with a 
    description, category, and amount. This is actually already pretty useful just to
    keep a broad inventory (better word for this) of expenses.


Planned features:
    - Delete transactions
    - Sum expenses (total, by category, date range)
    - Web portal for GUI management
