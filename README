I want to create a simple finance management application that I can use to do a few things:

    - Visualize my finanaces
        - Income
        - Expenses ( categories, people )

    - Show the information on a website


Version 0.1:

    There is currently very limited functionality. It is able to take in inputs with a 
    description, category, and amount. This is actually already pretty useful just to
    keep a broad inventory (better word for this) of expenses.

Version 0.2:

    Added the ability to search for specific transactions. Fields are optional, just press enter to
    skip them. Partial matches sort of work, e.g. "monitor" will match "LED monitor." 

Version 0.3:

    Added the ability to sum the total cost, cost by cateogory and cost by date range. Right now this is
    early on. It's not something that can be controlled by the user, it's hardcoded. I want these fields
    to be controlled by the web UI.

Planned features:
    [x] Search for specific transactions
    [x] Sum expenses (total, by category, date range)
    [ ] Web portal for GUI management
    [ ] Timed subscriptions
    [ ] Monthly report
